                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>
                        In the last 10 weeks, I worked on a project with a team of Aerospace students to develop a
                        simulation of
                        a swarm of inspection drones for aircraft inspection using Unity. I was responsible for
                        simulating
                        the
                        inspection performed by the drones, which included full 6DOF drone kinematics, outer loop drone
                        control,
                        drone camera simulations, pathfinding, and collision avoidance.

                        One of the highlights of the simulation was its generality. Although the project was focused on
                        aircraft
                        inspection, the algorithms we used were designed to be as general as possible, so the simulation
                        could
                        be used for the inspection of any 3D object, such as a wind turbine or a bridge.

                        One of the challenges we faced was determining the locations where the drones would take
                        pictures.
                        We
                        solved this problem using two intertwined algorithms. The first algorithm distributed the global
                        locations of the pictures around the aircraft, and the second fine-tuned the specific position
                        and
                        angle
                        of each picture. The resulting distribution around a Boeing 757 can be seen below, with green
                        dots
                        indicating the positions of the larger drone type, and blue dots indicating the positions of the
                        smaller
                        drone type.

                        Another challenge was distributing the picture locations among the drones to minimize inspection
                        time.
                        This is known as the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (MTSP), and we solved it using a
                        real-time
                        greedy algorithm. We then used an A* algorithm on a 3D graph to construct the routes between the
                        waypoints.

                        Finally, we implemented an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) system for the drones
                        to
                        avoid
                        collisions with each other and any obstacles in their environment. The ORCA system was able to
                        resolve
                        conflicts in real-time and allowed the drones to move safely around the aircraft and the
                        observer.

                        Overall, the project was a great learning experience and allowed me to apply my knowledge of
                        drone
                        kinematics, control, and pathfinding to a real-world problem. The final simulation, which can be
                        viewed
                        in Virtual Reality, shows the inspection being performed by the drones and their real-time
                        collision
                        avoidance.

                    <h1>More details</h1>
                    <p>
                        Three weeks ago nine other Aerospace students and I finished our Design Synthesis Exercise of a
                        Swarm of Inspection Drones For Aircraft Inspection. In the last part of this 10-week exercise, I
                        worked on simulating the inspection performed by the drones in Unity. This simulation featured
                        full
                        6DOF drone kinematics, outer loop drone control, drone camera simulations, pathfinding and
                        collision
                        avoidance. The final simulation can be viewed in Virtual Reality where the observer can walk
                        around
                        the aircraft while the inspection is being performed by the drones. The drones then also avoid
                        this
                        observer in real-time as can be seen below:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the aspects of the simulation that I am most proud of is its generality. Although the
                        scope
                        of the project was focused on the inspection of aircraft for maintenance, the used algorithms
                        were
                        selected and implemented to be as general as possible. This means that the simulation can also
                        be
                        used to simulate the drone inspection of any 3D object, be it a wind turbine, a Falcon 9 or a
                        bridge. I will now walk through the most interesting parts of the simulation in greater detail.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Generating the picture positions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Starting from the 3D model of the aircraft that has to be inspected, how the drones will inspect
                        this
                        aircraft must be determined. First, it must be determined which drones will take pictures at
                        which
                        locations. In distributing these picture locations, the number of pictures and the overlap
                        between
                        the
                        pictures has to be minimised while keeping the coverage of the aircraft as large as possible.
                        This
                        problem is further complicated because there are two drone types with different camera types
                        with
                        different properties. These properties, such as the resolution and gimbal limits, constrain the
                        allowed
                        picture positions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This distribution problem was solved using two intertwined algorithms, one which distributes the
                        global locations of the pictures around the aircraft and one which fine-tunes the specific
                        position
                        and angle of just one picture. The global algorithm performs multiple iterative sweeps of the
                        aircraft, during which the local algorithm optimises a mathematical scoring function using a
                        greedy
                        algorithm. The score of a given picture position takes into account how much of the surface is
                        covered, the overlap with other pictures, the angle to the normal of the surface etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The resulting distribution around a Boeing 757 can be seen below. The green dots indicate
                        picture
                        positions for a larger drone type (which has a downward gimballing camera), while the blue dots
                        indicate picture positions for a smaller drone with an upward gimballing camera.
                    </p>

                        Overall, the project was a great learning experience and allowed me to apply my knowledge of
                        drone
                        kinematics, control, and pathfinding to a real-world problem. The final simulation, which can be
                        viewed in Virtual Reality, shows the inspection being performed by the drones and their
                        real-time
                        collision avoidance.
