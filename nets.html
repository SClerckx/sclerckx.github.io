                    <p>
                        The numerical modelling of fishing nets
                         was the final project for my minor in Computational Science and Engineering. During this
                        project,
                        we developed a two-way non-linear cloth simulation, which was used to model the behaviour of
                        fishing nets.
                        The project was done in a team of 5 students, and I was responsible for the fluid simulation in
                        OpenFOAM.
                        <!-- <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SU0Ar0B0D7NPuwVxxALNMbVdCe-dGxTM/preview" width="100%" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe> -->
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        We developed a very computationally efficient simulation, which could to simulate a 3D
                        fishing net with
                        accurate correspondence to the literature. On the OpenFOAM side, I created a new OpenFOAM
                        application to convert
                        the output from the cloth simulation to a mesh suitable for OpenFOAM and to then convert the
                        fluid simulation results
                        back into pressures exerted onto the net. To do this, I generalised an approach in the
                        literature to work for
                        arbitrary net shapes while checking it still was identical in the simple case. Working on this
                        project was a fun experience,
                        and I learned a lot about OpenFOAM, using this experience to provide OpenFOAM workshops at the
                        Robotics Student Association.

                        Here, I will discuss some interesting aspects of the work I did for this project.
                        I will begin by briefly discussing the net simulation side of the simulation to 
                        give a background on that part.
                         After this, I will focus on the fluid simulation, starting with
                        our literature study on porosity and the work
                        of Chen et al. in 2016 [1], which provided the basis for our approach. I will then describe how
                        I
                        generalized the panel case to take into account volume, surface, and direction. Next, I will
                        explain how I parallelized the computations to improve performance. Finally, I will compare our
                        results to those found in the literature.

                    <h2>Nonlinear net solver</h2>
                    <p>
                        The net simulation was performed using a nonlinear cloth solver developed by other students on
                        the team.
                        The mass-spring model was based on the method proposed by Provot et al. (1995) [2] and initially
                        assumed
                        a steady, uniform flow to simulate the net behaviour. Later the net simulation could use the
                        pressure
                        fields computed by the fluid simulation to simulate the interaction with the fluid. Below is a
                        figure which
                        shows a qualitative comparison between the net simulation (without flow interactions) and
                        experimental data by
                        Chen et al. (2016) [1].

                    <h2>Simulating the net in a fluid</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the net simulation in place, we looked at methods to simulate the influence of the net on
                        the fluid.
                        We eventually settled on a method based on the work of Chen et al. (2016) [1], which was the
                        most promising
                        method we found in the literature for our limited computational power. The method is based on
                        the idea that
                        the net can be seen as a porous medium and that the pressure exerted by the fluid on the net
                        can be computed
                        by computing the momentum loss over the porous volume. The method essentially adds a momentum
                        sink term
                        to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in some regions of the mesh to model the presence
                        of a porous region.
                        This is known as the Darcy-Forchheimer equation; see [3].

                    <p>
                        The method of Chen et al. (2016) [1] is only directly applicable to a simple case where the net
                        has constant
                        Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients (see the image to the right). However, we wanted to apply
                        the
                        method to a net with
                        an arbitrary shape
                        as simulated by the cloth solver. In the ideal case, the net would be represented in a
                        complex
                        OpenFOAM mesh with varying Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients in every
                        cell. However, due to time (and experience) constraints, I chose to simplify the problem to a
                        case where the full
                        net shape is represented by a set of panels which behave exactly as those in the method of Chen
                        et al. This process is described in more detail below.

                    <h2>Generalising the panel case</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the panel case to be generalised, I needed to find a way to compute the Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients for 
                        each porous region representing a single panel.
                        This was done by generalising the coefficient calculation to arbitrary geometries, considering the panel's 
                        volume, surface, and direction. The
                        volume and surface of the
                        porous region were computed by integration over the relevant parts over the mesh. Calculating
                        the
                        volume for these regions in that way was trivial but calculating the projected surface area was
                        more difficult. The images
                        below represent the surface calculation process for a single panel. In these images, the cells
                        represent the porous region, and the plane represents the panel.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/projects/nets/Normals.JPG" class="image-width" style="width: 30%;" />
                        <img src="images/projects/nets/Redarea.JPG" class="image-width" style="width: 30%;" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The projected surface area of the porous region is calculated by taking the dot product of the
                        normal vector of the panel and the normal vector of every cell face and then integrating this
                        over
                        all the cell faces. The result is shown in the right image, where the black outline is the outline of
                        the projected area using this method. The red areas represent a small error in calculating the
                        areas this way. These areas are counted twice in the final result. This is because
                        calculating
                        the projected area with integration like this assumes that the porous region has a convex shape,
                        but that may not always be guaranteed (such as in this example).
                        However, this remains a reasonable assumption for the panels as the error is small
                        relative to the total area, given that this error also decreases when
                        the resolution of the mesh is increased.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The results of the above method are shown in the figures below. Here the case from Chen et al.
                        (2016) [1]
                        is recreated, but now no manual input of the Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients is required. This
                        method now
                        also allows
                        for easily changing the mesh resolution as the coefficients are computed automatically using the
                        volume and
                        the projected area of the porous region.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The image on the left shows a panel represented by a high-resolution porous region in black and
                        a low-resolution porous region in white. The image in the middle then shows the
                        Darcy-Forchheimer
                        as a function of this resolution and the image on the right shows the sensitivity of the drag
                        and
                        lift coefficients to the resolution. These results show that the panel simulation is not
                        sensitive
                        to the mesh resolution, only varying by a few percent over a sixteen-fold resolution increase.
                        This is
                        good news for the computational intensity of the method. These lift and drag coefficients also 
                        correspond exactly with the same case's results from Chen et al. (2016) [1]. This 
                        correspondence shows
                        that
                        the method is working as intended.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Parallelizing and computational resources</h2>
                    <p>
                        All of the above, including the solvers, had to be executed on our laptops, 
                        meaning we quickly ran into performance and storage bottlenecks. 
                         Because the simulations took
                        too long to complete for iteration on the results, we decided to look into parallelizing the   
                        entire procedure. This was also surprisingly required for the prerprocessing and postprocessing
                        of the results, which took almost as much computation as the fluid simulation itself. 
                        Implementing the parallelization broke a lot of our approach in the last 
                        weeks before the deadlines because of the large changes to mesh and file structures in the 
                        OpenFOAM frontend. This meant that we had to reverse engineer a lot of the parallelization 
                        performed by OpenFOAM and then refactor our solution. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        On top of this, the project was completed during COVID, which meant a purely online work environment. 
                        The ensuing cocktail of gigantic file transfers, different program environments and operating 
                        systems made the project a great lesson in flexibility and adaptability. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Correspondence with literature</h2>
                    <p>
                        Despite the above troubles, our results still corresponded very well with the literature.
                        For example, the image below shows the simulation of a net configuration described 
                        in the work of Tang et al.
                        (2019) [4], where the Vertical Opening Ratio (VOR) describes how much the net opens under a 
                        particular
                        flow. In the figure on the right, it can be seen that the VOR, as simulated by our method, follows
                        a similar power law as obtained by Tang et al. (2019) [4].

                        Studying the convergence of the full net simulation, a slightly worrying trend was observed. The
                        figure below shows the drag coefficient and simulated velocities at several stations
                        in the net as a function of the resolution of the mesh. It can be seen in this figure that slow 
                        convergence to steady values is present. However, we could not increase the resolution of our 
                        simulation far enough to observe the convergence to the final values. This is in stark contrast
                        to the simple panel case, which was not sensitive to the mesh resolution at all.

                    <p>
                        We hypothesized that this is because the net, in this case, was not a simple geometry.
                        This means that increasing the mesh resolution can have nonlinear effects on the 
                        flow. An example of a complex net configuration with effects like this 
                        would be the case of a net with a modest opening in the middle. At a certain low
                        resolution, this opening would not be resolved anymore by the mesh, and this would lead to a drastically
                        different flow field. 

                        However, as we observed, in simple cases it is possible to get very far with only 
                        simple simulation steps. In some instances, it was even observed that the pure cloth simulation
                        without the fluid simulation in the loop could have significant predictive power. This was in situations
                        where the assumption of a steady uniform flow, as made by the cloth model, was valid.

                    <h2>My experience working on the project</h2>
                    <p>
                        Working on this project was an outstanding experience; we had a great team and tutors. I had to pick
                        up the usage and development for OpenFOAM in a short amount of time, together with all the
                        complications of running it with the windows subsystem for Linux in VS Code. After this project,
                        I went on to use OpenFOAM in other projects and taught it to others at the RSA
                        in workshops.
