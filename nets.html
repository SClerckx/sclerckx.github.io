                    <p>
                        This was the final project for my minor in Computational Science and Engineering. During this
                        project
                        we developed a two-way non-linear cloth simulation, which was used to model the behaviour of
                        fishing nets.
                        The project was done in a team of 5 students, and I was responsible for the fluid simulation in
                        OpenFOAM.
                        <!-- <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SU0Ar0B0D7NPuwVxxALNMbVdCe-dGxTM/preview" width="100%" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe> -->
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        We developed a very computationally efficient simulation, which was able to simulate a 3D
                        fishing net with
                        accurate correspondence to the literature. On the OpenFOAM side, I developed a new OpenFOAM
                        application for converting
                        the output from the cloth simulation to a mesh suitable for OpenFOAM and for then converting the
                        fluid simulation results
                        back into pressures exerted onto the net. In order to do this, I generalised an approach in the
                        literature to work for
                        arbitray net shapes while checking it still was identical in the simple case. Working on this
                        project was a fun experience
                        and I learned a lot about OpenFOAM, using this experience to provide OpenFOAM workshops at the
                        Robotics Student Association.

                        Here, I will discuss some interesting aspects of the work I did for this project.
                        I will begin by shortly discussing the net simulation side of the simulation to also give a
                        background
                        on that part of the simulation. After this I will focus on the fluid simulation, starting with
                        our literature study on porosity and the work
                        of Chen et al. in 2016 [1], which provided the basis for our approach. I will then describe how
                        I
                        generalized the panel case to take into account volume, surface, and direction. Next, I will
                        explain how I parallelized the computations to improve performance. Finally, I will compare our
                        results to those found in the literature.

                    <h2>Nonlinear net solver</h2>
                    <p>
                        The net simulation was performed using a nonlinear cloth solver developed by other students on
                        the team.
                        The mass-spring model was based on the method proposed by Provot et al. (1995) [2] and initially
                        assumed
                        a steady, uniform flow to simulate the net behaviour. Later the net simulation could use the
                        pressure
                        fields computed by the fluid simulation to simulate the interaction with the fluid. Below is a
                        figure which
                        shows a qualitative comparison between the net simulation (without flow interactions) and
                        experimental data by
                        Chen et al. (2016) [1].

                    <h2>Simulating the net in a fluid</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the net simulation in place, we looked at methods to simulate the influence of the net on
                        the fluid.
                        We eventually settled on a method based on the work of Chen et al. (2016) [1], which was the
                        most promising
                        method we found in the literature for our limited computational power. The method is based on
                        the idea that
                        the net can be seen as a porous medium, and that the pressure exerted by the fluid on the net
                        can be computed
                        by computing the momentum loss over the porous volume. The method essentially adds a momentum
                        sink term
                        to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in some regions of the mesh to model the presence
                        of a porous region.
                        This is know as the Darcy-Forchheimer equation, see [3].

                    <p>
                        The method of Chen et al. (2016) [1] is only directly applicable to a simple case, where the net
                        has constant
                        Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients (see the image to the right) but in this case we wanted to apply
                        the
                        method to a net with
                        arbitrary shape
                        as simulated by the cloth solver. In the most ideal case the net would be represented in a
                        complex
                        OpenFOAM mesh with varying Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients in every
                        cell. However, due to time (and experience) constraints I chose to simplify the problem to a
                        case where the full
                        net shape is represented by a set of panels which behave exactly as those in the method of Chen
                        et al. This is described in more detail below.

                    <h2>Generalising the panel case</h2>
                    <p>
                        In order for the panel case to be generalised, I needed to find a way to compute the
                        Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients
                        for each porous region which represents a single panel. This was done by generalising the
                        coefficient calculation to
                        arbitrary geometries, taking into account the volume, surface, and direction of the panel. The
                        volume and surface of the
                        porous region were computed by integration over the relevant parts over the mesh. Calculating
                        the
                        volume for these regions in that way was trivial but calculating the projected surface area was
                        more difficult. The images
                        below represents the surface calculation process for a single panel. In these images, the cells
                        represent the porous region and the plane represents the panel.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/projects/nets/Normals.JPG" class="image-width" style="width: 30%;" />
                        <img src="images/projects/nets/Redarea.JPG" class="image-width" style="width: 30%;" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The projected surface area of the porous region is calculated by taking the dot product of the
                        normal vector of the panel and the normal vector of every cell face, and then integrating this
                        over
                        all cell faces. The result is show in the right image, where the black outline is the outline of
                        the projected area using this method. The red areas represent a small error in calculating the
                        areas in this way. These areas are counted twice in the final result. This is because
                        calculating
                        the projected area with integration like this assumes that the porous region has a convex shape
                        but that may not be always guaranteed (such as in this example).
                        However, this remains a reasonable assumption for the panels as the error is small
                        relative to the total area and given that this error also decreases when
                        the resolution of the mesh is increased.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The results of the above method are shown in the figures below. Here the case from Chen et al
                        (2016) [1]
                        is recreated but now no manual input of the Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients is required. This now
                        also allows
                        for easily changing the mesh resolution as the coefficients are computed automatically using the
                        volume and
                        the projected area of the porous region.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The image on the left shows a panel represented by a high resolution porous region in black and
                        by
                        a low resolution porous region in white. The image in the middle then shows the
                        Darcy-Forchheimer
                        as a function of this resolution and the image on the right shows the sensitivity of the drag
                        and
                        lift coefficients to the resolution. These results show that the panel simulation is not
                        sensitive
                        to the mesh resolution, only varying by a few percent over a sixteen-fold resolution increase.
                        This is
                        good news for the computational intensity of the method. These lift and drag coefficients also
                        correspond exactly with the results from Chen et al. (2016) [1] for the same case. This shows
                        that
                        the method is working as intended.

                        Corresponded very well with literature (net opening).

                        Nonlinearity in resolution when simulating full net. Fluid simulation not so cheap as initially thought.

                        Get very far with only net simulation assuming steady uniform flow.

                         went on to use OpenFOAM in other projects and taught it to others at the RSA
