                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennart-bult">Lennart Bult</a> and I are designing and
                        building a thrust vector controlled drone to
                        replicate the flight
                        profile of a Starship test flight, including the belly flop and landing, completely
                        autonomously.
                        The drone is controlled using a counterrotating propeller setup with a gimbal for each propeller
                        and using body flaps. We control the drone using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and an external
                        positioning system. For indoor positioning, we developed our own camera triangulation system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are currently working on an outer-loop control system, simulation and validation of the
                        belly flop maneuver, and the aerodynamic design of the drone. When we have succesfully
                        replicated
                        the Starship flight profile, we will add the Super Heavy stage to the replica. We are currently
                        also considering the feasibility of replicating the Stage Zero Starship catching mechanism.

                    <h2>Motivation and inspiration</h2>

                    <p>
                        The inspiration for this project came in 2020 when I watched the Starship SN8 flight with some
                        friends. The belly flop and subsequent landing of SN10 left a lasting impression on me, as it
                        seemed like something straight out of science fiction [1]. From that moment, I knew I wanted to
                        replicate those maneuvers in some way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems that others had the same idea after watching the Starship flight. Soon after the SN8
                        flight, Nicholas Rehm built a manually controlled, thrust vectored Starship replica drone [2].
                        Around the
                        same time, Joe Barnard was working on his sprite test vehicle [3] to demonstrate fully
                        autonomous thrust vector control for his Falcon-9-style landing model rockets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by these projects, my friend Lennart Bult and I decided to build our own autonomous
                        Starship replica drone. Our goal was to replicate the flight profile of a Starship test flight,
                        including the belly flop and landing, completely autonomously.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Preliminary design</h2>

                    <p>
                        We based a lot of our preliminary design on Nicholas Rehm's drone, which used a counterrotating
                        propeller setup with a gimbal for each propeller. This setup is preferred because it removes the
                        adverse yaw generated by the acceleration of the propellers and the conservation of angular
                        momentum. It also allows for thrust vectoring in the two horizontal axes and for controlling the
                        yaw by differentially accelerating the two propellers. The only change we made to this basic
                        design was to go with a slightly more powerful propulsion system, as we wanted the option of
                        including more computing power on the drone for autonomous flights.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To get a good idea of the drone's performance, we used the eCalc xcopterCalc tool [4] for rapid
                        prototyping
                        of the design. In retrospect, the predictions of this tool were surprisingly accurate. The
                        largest constraint we had was the small inline propeller diameter, which severely limited the
                        propulsive efficiency we could achieve. ECalc estimates our efficiency at 3.35 g/W which
                        is quite low compared to 10 g/W for a typical quadcopter.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the things we wanted to verify first was the thrust we could expect from our
                        counterrotating propeller setup. We used the eCalc tool to calculate the thrust, but it does not
                        take into account interactions between the propellers. So, we went straight to the test bench
                        and measured the thrust of our system. We found that the thrust at full throttle was 1.2 kg.
                        We also measured the thrust of the propellers individually and found that the counterrotating
                        setup only incurred a 15% loss in thrust compared to putting the same propellers in parallel,
                        which was better than we expected based on reading RC group forums.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/projects/starship/ecalc.png" class="image-width" style="width: 49%;" />
                        <img src="images/projects/starship/thrust.png" class="image-width" style="width: 40%;" />
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This higher-than-expected thrust was a good thing because we had overshot the mass budget for
                        the rest of the drone by about 20%. Fortunately, these changes mostly cancelled each other out,
                        and only the flight time of the drone was slightly shorter (around 4 minutes in pure hover).
                        Below is a list of the components we used for the drone for reference:

                    <h2>Flight control and electronics</h2>


                    <p>
                        To control the drone, we decided to split the control system into two parts: an inner loop that
                        controls the drone's
                        attitude and an outer loop that controls the drone's position. The inner loop keeps the drone
                        level and stable, while the outer loop directs its movement in space.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the inner loop, we heavily modified Nicholas Rehm's amazing
                        dRehmFlight flight controller [5]. This flight controller uses inertial information to
                        estimate the drone's attitude and then uses PID controllers to stabilize the drone.
                        The controller runs on the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and uses a MPU6050 IMU for attitude
                        estimation using a Madgwick filter. It also has limited support for the usage of the MPU9250
                        IMU, which has an integrated magnetometer.
                        However, after integration, we found that the MPU9250's magnetometer was not
                        accurate enough for our purposes. As a result, we upgraded to a BNO055 IMU, which
                        handles sensor fusion internally. Below is a further overview of the inner loop control system:
                    </p>

                        Integrating the advanced IMUs into the dRehmFlight flight controller was not an easy task,
                        especially since this was the first time this particular combination of sensors and
                        microcontrollers had been used with dRehmFlight. However, after some work, we were able to get
                        everything working and contributed our knowledge to the dRehmFlight forums,
                        assisting others with similar difficulties [6].

                        As you can see in the above video, even with inner loop stabilisation (kinda) working, there is 
                        still a lot of drift and sway in the position of the drone. This is because it is hard 
                        to sense the drone's position in space using only the IMU. This is the point where we started
                        developing the outer loop control system, which is a pretty hard problem with the sensor set 
                        that we have. We are currently working on this aspect of the
                        project and will update this page with more information as we progress.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Positioning system</h2>

                    <p>
                        To enable the outer loop control system, we needed a way to determine the drone's position in
                        space. For outdoor flights, we plan to use a GPS system, but for indoor flights we needed a
                        different solution. We decided to quickly develop an external tracking system using our
                        smartphones and the OpenCV library. This system uses the cameras on the smartphones to detect
                        the drone and then triangulates its position in space using the cameras' known orientation and
                        relative position. While the system doesn't produce highly accurate results, it is sufficient
                        for the development of the outer loop control system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This system was runs on a central computer that communicates with the
                        smartphones via a local WiFi network. The drone is tracked using the OpenCV CSRT tracker [7],
                        which runs at approximately 40 FPS for the two merged camera streams on my laptop (Intel
                        i7-8750H, 16GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 2080). The whole system, including communication, provides a
                        position estimate at a rate of about 30 Hz, which is sufficient for drift correction. The
                        picture on the right shows the point cloud generated by the system when tracking the starship,
                        which I moved in a star shape.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/projects/starship/object_tracking.png" class="image-width"
                            style="width: 30%;" />
                        <img src="images/projects/starship/pointcloudcropped.png" class="image-width"
                            style="width: 30%;" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        We are also considering the use of inside-out tracking systems, especially if we find that the
                        outside GPS odometry is not accurate or fast enough. However, this would be a costly step, so we
                        are weighing our options. The results of Joe Barnard [3] are promising, but our flight profile
                        may be more demanding.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Further work</h2>

                    <p>
                        We are currently working on the outer loop control system and are planning to integrate it with
                        the inner loop control system. We are also currently working on simulating the belly flop
                        maneuver,
                        both from the aerodynamic and control system perspective. This part of the flight profile will
                        be
                        the most challenging, as it will involve high potential energies and a loss of control might
                        result in a crash as with the Starships and Nicholas' drone [2].
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once these aspects of the project are completed, we will start working on a super heavy
                        (booster)
                        version of the drone. This way we can also replicate the flight profile of the complete Starship
                        stack. We are also playing around with the idea of catching the drone as it lands, such as
                        SpaceX,
                        but this is still in the early stages of development.
